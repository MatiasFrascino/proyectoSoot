# SOOT Project

This project was developed as the final assignment for the JavaScript course at Coderhouse. The goal of the project was to create a simulation of a bar application using JavaScript. The application allows users to interact with a virtual bar environment and perform various actions related to ordering drinks, checking the menu, and managing orders.

## Features

- **Menu Display**: The app displays a menu of available drinks with their respective prices.
- **Order Placement**: Users can select drinks from the menu and place orders.
- **Order Summary**: The app provides a summary of the items selected for the order, including the total cost.
- **Interactive Interface**: The interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, enhancing the user experience.
- **Realism**: The simulation attempts to mimic a real bar environment, providing a realistic feel to the user interactions.

## Usage

1. Upon opening the app, you will see the available drinks on the menu and search for categories.
2. Click on the drinks you want to order. The selected drinks will be added to the order summary.
3. Review the order summary to see the selected items and the total cost.
